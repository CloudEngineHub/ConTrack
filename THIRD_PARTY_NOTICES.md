The RB-Y1A portions of `assets/urdf/rby1a_sharpa.urdf`, the meshes under `assets/meshes/rby1a`, and the corresponding generated USD assets are derived from the official Rainbow Robotics RB-Y1 model. ConTrack integrates the RB-Y1A model with dual Sharpa hands and adds simulator-specific articulation, actuator, collision, and physics configuration. The resulting files are modified derivatives and are not official Rainbow Robotics releases.

ConTrack integrates the left and right hand models with RB-Y1A and adds simulator-specific physical parameters, actuator configuration, contact sensing, and collision filtering.
